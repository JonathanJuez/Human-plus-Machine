Summary

**Daugherty and Wilson**

The authors give some concepts to put the reader in context by describing three historical stages in business transformation:

**First stage:** Henry Ford in 1913 innovo with mass production in factories with standardized processes and established the efficiency of companies with time optimization.

**Second stage:** From 1970 until the process reengineering movement of the 1990s, it was possible to automate administrative processes.

**Third** stage: AI is changing business processes by increasing and complementing human capabilities. 

The authors present it as a "symbiosis" because machines are assigned the tasks they perform best as; repetitive tasks, analyzing huge data sets, managing routine cases. And humans do what they do best: resolve ambiguous information, exercise their judgment in difficult cases, and deal with dissatisfied clients.

Therefore, this set offers better business results and several companies have now joined this new stage; further automating companies.

**The missing medium**

This term refers to the ability of AI systems to extend human skills and that collaborating with us achieves great productivity results that were previously impossible.  

The authors do not refer to this concept because few talk about it now and only a small fraction of companies are working to achieve this goal. 

The study of the first people using AI clarifies the picture of the future and identifying the different ways in which companies can fill the missing middle space, creating new jobs that offer employment opportunities. 

**The MELDS framework** 

The authors through their research demonstrated that leading companies are successfully developing towards innovation and gaining the skills needed to capitalize on the Union between machines, and humans by applying the five principles of relations with; Mentality, Experimentation, Leadership, Data, Skills. These five principles are called the MELDS framework.


***Part One: Imagining a future of humans + machines ... Today***

The authors mention that companies that use machines to replace human labor will eventually stagnate, so those who think of innovative ways for machines to increase human qualities will become the leaders of their industries. 

This chapter presents a number of companies that have already implemented this fusion between man-machine for manufacturing, maintenance, warehouses and agriculture. These pioneers have put people and machines enhanced by AI at stake, in the functions for which they are most suitable, and are reaping the benefits.

An example of these cases of interaction between human+machine are:

- Maintenance reimagined. GE retains statistics for a large number of customers from the point of installation and uses machine learning technology to predict when certain parts may fail based on their current state,
- At BHP Billiton Ltd. Unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with infrared sensors and telescopic zoom can cause problems with safety beams and roads under construction. They also check the blast zones to make sure they are free of people before detonation. 

When the strengths of human workers and machines are honestly evaluated, and what they do well when they collaborate, a whole new world of possibilities arises to run a company and design its processes.

***Chapter 2: Robot Accounting: AI in Business Functions***

The authors state that AI technology can filter and analyze information flows from a variety of sources, it also automates repetitive tasks and increases human skills and knowledge. In addition, they consider how to determine processes that can be changed and how much change, as they explore which processes go around people allowing human workers to be more human. 

The authors expose use cases to the business industry such as the following industries:

- Arizona State University now uses an adaptation learning tool system that uses machine learning to provide personalized tutoring to students in introductory classes
- Unilever's hiring process. In the first round of the application process, you will be asked to play twelve online games based on evidence from the field of cognitive neuroscience. Games help evaluate certain traits, such as risk aversion and the ability to read emotional cues versus con- But if you move on to the next round, you would be asked to conduct a recorded interview in which you would answer a series of questions designed for the specific position you were interested in. And this is where sophisticated AI technologies come into play: Your answers would be analyzed by HireVue, an AI application that not only takes note of the words you use, but also your body language and tone. The best candidates for the position are invited to the company's offices, where they can be evaluated by humans who would make the final hiring decision.

This Unilever example not only shows how different technologies can be used for different parts of the same application, but also the power of collaboration between people and machines.

The chapter ends with a glossary about the multiple AI technologies that are currently used as; machine learning, AI capabilities, and its applications.

***Chapter 3: The Ultimate Innovation Machine: AI in R&D and Business Innovation***

In the main steps of the R&D process, they perform hypotheses, experiment design and results analysis, AI can be more efficient and improve results.

At every step of the R&D process, AI is giving a remarkable boost to product researchers and developers.  It is changing the way they conceive their experiments, freeing them to explore ways that would have been gone before because they would have required too much time and money. AI also allows researchers to extract data from previous tests to discover new ideas and conduct virtual experiments to test any hypothesis faster. However, as companies increasingly deploy AI tools to reimagine their R&D processes, leaders (the L-part of MELDS) must always keep in mind the ethical issues that arise, especially when it comes to human beings. Imastering a future of humans + machines.

***Chapter 4: Say hello to your new office robots:***

The authors analyzed the impact of AI on customer service, sales and marketing, and sidebars analyze AI in retail and AI in the sales and marketing process.

This chapter has also hinted at how new types of jobs can emerge in the front office. As bots become critical components of customer service infrastructure, for example, their personalities will need to be designed, updated, and managed. Experts in unexpected disciplines such as human conversation, dialogue, humor, poetry and empathy. - In addition, in the new world of augmented and automated work, UI designers and experience designers will be of the utmost importance as the interface between people - whether customers or employees of an organization - will have to customers in an organization or its employees - will have a disproportionate impact on whether an AI-based product or service survives and thrives , or if it fails.

In this chapter, we learned about companies that are at the forefront of reimagine their front-office and customer interaction processes.

***Part Two: The Lost Medium: Reimagine Processes with AI***

***Part Two Introduction***

In this part of the book the authors provide a guide to reinvent traditional work processes, because, to exploit all the advantages of AI, companies must fill the "Missing Medium" and consider new workplaces for employees, establishing new relationships between machines and humans, modifying the concepts of management and the concept of work itself.

***Chapter 5: Properly Raising Your Algorithms: Three Roles Humans Play in the Development and Implementation of Responsible AI***

This section describes how humans are enhancing machine capabilities, and emphasizes the role of humans in complementing machines, the author describes three essential features of specialized emerging works such as trainers, explainers, and sustainers. It also describes the activities that each of these roles played within machine learning, in turn states that work will arise in which they can lead to labor from secondary education staff as in turn other jobs will require advanced degrees to cover areas such as compliance with ethics.

companies deploying AI systems need to rethink their talent and learning strategies to better attract, train, manage, and retain these people. And it's clear that AI will require new capabilities, policies, and processes, not just in IT, but across the enterprise.

***Chapter 6: Excellent Results of Ordinary People: Three Ways AI Releases New Levels of Productivity***

This chapter mentions the characteristics that could deploy high levels of productivity with man-machine fusion; amplify, interact and embody a new human potential, reducing all kinds of iterative, repetitive and redundant work that significantly affects the human worker, this new symbiosis offers significant improvements in the way people work, giving them new superpowers that highlight the ways in which workers improve the effectiveness of AI, being safer and more committed workers. The chapter describes specific works for AI agents that amplify, interact, and personify.

***Chapter 7: A Leader's Guide to Reinventing the Process: Five Steps to StartR***

In this chapter the authors identify the challenge facing the MELDS framework in organizational culture, as executives must adopt an open mind to change, in which processes must be reimagineed and reinvented, and the current picture of how work is done.

Executives should be the right mindset to do the work at the missing midpoint, using AI they should focus on experimentation to test and refine that vision, discovering and co-creating.

This requires leadership: managers who promote responsible AI, fostering a culture of trust towards AI through the implementation of railings, minimizing minimization of moral deformation zones, and other actions that address the legal, ethical and moral problems that may arise, which can arise when these types of systems are deployed. Building-measuring-learning.

Last but not least, process reimagination requires good data, and companies need to develop data supply chains that can provide information from a wide variety of sources. They must think with dynamism, expand access and variety, and allow discovery. 



***Chapter 8: Expanding Human-Machine Collaboration: Eight New Fusion Skills for an AI Workplace***

The concept of fusion skills - capabilities to combine the relative forces of a human and a machine to create a better result than any of them could obtain on their own.  

Artificial intelligence brings another dimension to this type of biotechnical symbiosis: intelligent machines are neural opportunistic with respect to their own strengths. By design, they collect information about their environment and incorporate it into their own cognition. So these eight skills, the "S" part of MELDS, emphasize a new type of relational competence that is rarely or never discussed in current economic analyses or in the talent talent development programs of companies. Fusion skills require a new way of thinking about human experience and, by extension, a very focus on education and retraining of labor.

Promoting these fusion skills is the fifth practice of the MELDS framework. These skills include the following:

- Rehumanize time: reinvent business processes to extend the time available for clearly human tasks and learning.
- Responsible standardization: shape the purpose and perception of human-machine collaborations as they relate to individuals, businesses, and society.
- Trial integration: choose a course of action amid machine uncertainty.
- Smart Questioning: Know the best way to ask an AI agent questions, at all levels of abstraction, to get the information you need.
- Bot-based empowerment: collaboration with smart agents to outperform their weight at work.
- Holistic fusion: development of mental models of AI agents that improve collaboration outcomes.
- Reciprocal learning: Teach new skills to AI agents while receiving on-the-job training to work well within enhanced AI processes.
- Reinvent relentlessly: think of novel ways to review work, processes, and business models for exponential increases in improvement.
